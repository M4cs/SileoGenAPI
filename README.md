# SileoGen

This repository is home to the source code of the https://sileogen.com/v1 API. This API in it's current state only has 1 endpoint which generates depictions for Sileo. If you would like to contribute feel free to do so by making a fork and then pull request. All changes are appreciated!

# Contributing

To start clone the repository and run `virtualenv .flaskapp`. From there enable the virtualenv shell and run `pip install flask flask-restful`. Now all you have to do is run `flask run` and the server will start at http://localhost:5000.

# Documentation

All API Documentation resides at https://sileogen.com/docs. Currently there is only 1 endpoint so there isn't much to read.
